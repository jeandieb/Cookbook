GitHub insights of contributions
Jean - commits were mainly addressing Dr. Mongeâ€™s feedback and building the menu and some of the queries.

John - Commits were from fixing code from the suggestions given by Dr. Monge. Made sure every change I made
did not cause any errors. Worked on the creation of the edit recipe functions as well as helped with some of
the creations of the queries that were required in the assignment.

Kearne - Most of the commits were fixes on the code from the suggestions given by Dr. Monge. The other
commits were during collaborations with the other teammates in updating the statements for the
queries in main, troubleshooting and fixing small errors in code like capitalizations.

Nikki - All commits were through collaboration with others through discord because of initial configuration
issues. Worked with others to create queries, troubleshoot issues and adding complexity to existing ones.

Because Jean did the majority of the work in this second part of the project, he deserves 40% of the points.
John should get 20%. Kearne should get 20%. Nikki should get 20%.
