Database Project Team 7 Part 1 Contributions


Originally, we divided the classes evenly between all of us. But some had more work than others due to dependencies from the other classes. 

Jean Dieb
- Started and finished Cuisine, Ingredient, Recipe, and Step entity classes and associated creation entity methods in the StarterApplication
- Helped Kearne to finish Review and FoodCritic entity classes
- Has the most commits on Github because he is the main one helping to check the othersâ€™ work and helps change whatever necessary to make the entities work with each other

John Quach

Kearne Permalino
- Started the Review and FoodCritic entity classes 
- Started the createReviewEntity and createFoodCriticEntity methods in the StarterApplication

Nikki Benitez
- Started and completed the IngredientAmount entity classes




Because Jean did the majority of the work in this part of the project, he deserves 40% of the points. John should get 20%. Kearne should get 20%. Nikki should get 20%.
