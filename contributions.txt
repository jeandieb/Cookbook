Database Project Team 7 Part 1 Contributions


Originally, we divided the classes evenly between all of us. But some had more work than others due to dependencies from the other classes. 

Jean Dieb
- Started and finished Cuisine, Ingredient, Recipe, and Step entity classes and associated creation entity methods in the StarterApplication
- Helped Kearne to finish Review and FoodCritic entity classes
- Has the most commits on Github because he is the main one helping to check the othersâ€™ work and helps change whatever necessary to make the entities work with each other

John Quach
- Created entity classes for User, Chefs, and Experienced_Cuisine_Chefs
- Created function to persist Users, Chefs, and Experienced_Cuisine_Chefs into the database

Kearne Permalino
- Created the Review and FoodCritic entity classes 
- Created the methods to persist Reviews and FoodCritics to the database

Nikki Benitez
- Started and completed the IngredientAmount entity classes
- Started Recipe and Ingredient classes, but were not added due to other dependencies needed. 


Because Jean did the majority of the work in this part of the project, he deserves 40% of the points. John should get 20%. Kearne should get 20%. Nikki should get 20%.
